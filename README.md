# better-each-day

# Vision for the project
The goal for this project was support efforts to improve at something each day/week/month.

# Story behind the project
Recently I decided to get better at pushups.  My plan was to do 1 pushup on 1 Jan, 2 on 2 Jan,...32 on 1 Feb, 33 on 2 Feb.  With the intent on doing pushups everday and working my way up to doing 365 the last day of December.
I kept track of the days manually with a spreadsheet so that I could remember how many I was supposed to do that day, but I found it rather clunky and hard to manage.
I was thinking back on this recently and thinking how much easier it would have been to do with a pretty simple application.

# Development plan
This is intended to be built up incrementally from a very simple program to do the basics, working up to a more full-featured implementation

# Intended Features
Initially it should allow a user to enter a start date, and it kicks out the number of days since that day.

Next, it should add persistence, so that a user could enter a start date and an activity, which the program would save.  After that a user could just run a command to check the current day number.

Then it would add a check in feature so that a user can check in each day which the program can store.  This way way the program can store a running total of how many have been done, and how consistently.
